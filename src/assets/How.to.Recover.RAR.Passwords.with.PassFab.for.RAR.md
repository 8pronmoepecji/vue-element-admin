PassFab for RAR will automatically detect the encryption type of your RAR archive and show it on the screen. You can also see some information about your file, such as the size, modified date, and path.
  
## Step 3: Choose an Attack Type and Start Recovery
 
The final step is to choose an attack type and start the recovery process. PassFab for RAR offers four attack types: Brute-force Attack, Brute-force with Mask Attack, Dictionary Attack, and Smart Attack. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your situation.
 
A Brute-force Attack tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the right password. This is the most thorough but also the slowest method. You can use this option if you have no clue about your password at all.
 
A Brute-force with Mask Attack allows you to specify some parameters of your password, such as the length, character set, prefix, suffix, etc. This can speed up the recovery process by reducing the search space. You can use this option if you remember some details about your password.
 
A Dictionary Attack uses a predefined list of words or phrases as possible passwords. This is the fastest but also the least effective method. You can use this option if you think your password is a common word or phrase.
 
A Smart Attack combines all the above methods and tries them one by one until it finds the right password. This is the most intelligent but also the most time-consuming method. You can use this option if you want to try everything possible.
 
Once you have chosen an attack type, click on the "Start" button to begin the recovery process. PassFab for RAR will display the progress, speed, time elapsed, and time remaining on the screen. You can also pause or stop the process at any time.
 
When PassFab for RAR finds your password, it will show it on a pop-up window. You can copy it to your clipboard or save it to a file. Then, you can use it to open your RAR archive and access your files.
