The software uses a powerful encryption algorithm to ensure that your files are safe and unreadable by anyone who does not have the correct password. You can choose from different encryption modes and key lengths to suit your needs and preferences. You can also create multiple encrypted volumes with different passwords for different purposes.
  
The software also has a stealth mode that allows you to hide the encrypted volumes from plain sight. This way, you can avoid attracting unwanted attention or suspicion from anyone who might access your computer or USB drive. You can also use a decoy password to open a fake volume in case you are forced to reveal your password.
  
The software is easy to update and maintain, as it does not require any installation or registration. You can check for updates online or download them manually from the official website. You can also contact the developer for any feedback, suggestions, or technical support.
