However, Adobe CS6 Master Collection is not cheap. It costs around $2,600 for a full license, which is a lot of money for most people. That's why some people look for alternative ways to get it without paying. One of the most popular methods is to use a keygen, which is a program that generates serial numbers or activation codes for software.
 
A keygen can help you bypass the online activation process and use Adobe CS6 Master Collection without any restrictions. However, using a keygen is not legal and can expose you to various risks. For example, you might download a fake or infected keygen that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. You might also face legal consequences if you are caught using pirated software.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen to download Adobe CS6 Master Collection for free. Instead, we suggest you try some of the legitimate ways to get Adobe software at a lower cost or even for free. Here are some of them:
 
- Use the free trial version. Adobe offers a 30-day free trial for all its products, including CS6 Master Collection. You can download it from their official website and use it for a limited time without any limitations. This is a great way to test the software and see if it suits your needs.
- Use the student or teacher discount. If you are a student or a teacher, you can get up to 60% off on Adobe software with the Creative Cloud subscription plan. You can access all the latest versions of Adobe products for a monthly or annual fee. You can also get CS6 Master Collection as a one-time purchase with a 80% discount.
- Use the older versions. If you don't need the latest features and updates, you can use the older versions of Adobe software that are still available for download. For example, you can get CS2 Master Collection for free from Adobe's website. You just need to create an Adobe account and enter a serial number that they provide.

As you can see, there are some ways to get Adobe CS6 Master Collection legally and safely without using a keygen. We hope this article has helped you find the best option for you.
